The Rhythm

Overview
This project encompasses two main functionalities: recording and processing sound, and melody generation using a genetic algorithm. The first part involves capturing audio, applying auto-tuning, and visualizing Fourier graphs. 
The second part focuses on generating melodies through a genetic algorithm, providing a diverse set of musical sequences.

Usage
Part 1: Recording and Processing Sound
1. Recording Sound
2. Auto-Tuning and Fourier Visualization
Run the processing script:
This script applies auto-tuning to the recorded sound and displays original and auto-tuned versions along with their Fourier graphs.
Part 2: Melody Generation with Genetic Algorithm
1. Melody Generation
This script generates melodies using a genetic algorithm, evolving over multiple generations.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyAudio
NumPy
Matplotlib
librosa (for signal processing)
